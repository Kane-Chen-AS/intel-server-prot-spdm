# Intel Server PRoT SPDM Python package (intel-server-prot-spdm)

## Description

**intelprot** is a python package for Intel Server Platform Root of Trust (PRoT) 
spdm development. It is used for PRoT design of SPDM based device attestation. 
This package is useful for both Intel PFR based PRoT and non-Intel PFR based PRoT system.

The tool package includes scripts to build Intel PRoT (PFR) compliant firmware, update
capsule, and attestation firmware manifest (AFM) generation for attestation using DMTF SPDM_Emu open source project. 

This Python package is released to assist multiple generations of Intel server platforms PRoT design for device attestation.

This package has been used for SPDM based device attestation using SMBus tool (Aardvark) on Intel Eaglestream reference platform with
open source project [spdm-emu](https://github.com/DMTF/spdm-emu).

Intel速 Platform Firmware Resilience (Intel速 PFR) is a hardware-based
cybersecurity solution for platform firmware resilience. It is Intel PRoT solution. About Intel速
PFR: <https://www.intel.com/pfr>. Intel速 PFR Whitley Max10 FPGA source code is [released in
GitHub](https://github.com/intel/platform-firmware-resiliency%3E).
